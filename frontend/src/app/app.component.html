    <p>Welcome to QML NBA Predictions developed by Brandan Quinn!</p>
    <p>This web application was built to provide NBA game predictions based on point differential.</p>
    <p>These predictions are generated using a Neural Network provided by Tensorflow's Keras API: </p>
    <p>If you click on the link to Today's Predictions in the menubar you will be greeted with predictions for each game played today.</p>
    <p>If no games appear, it is likely that there are no NBA basketball games played on that date.</p>
    <p>Similarly, if you select Predictions By Date, you will be able to input a date. Once the date is selected, you will be redirected to view the predictions at that date.</p>
